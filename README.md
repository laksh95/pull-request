# pull-request

By default this script assumes that you want to make a pull request to a branch called `develop`. If you want to make a pull 
request to another branch execute the script by passing the branch name as the first parameter. It automatically detects your 
current branch will make a pull request for your current branch to the develop branch.

HOW TO  RUN

I use oh-my-zsh. I cloned this repo to my `.oh-my-zsh` directory. Then in the `.zshrc` file I created an alias to execute this script.

Now all I have to do is push my code and call the alias.
